# intro-to-python

## Exercise 1:

### Main Goals:
 - Initialize Python virtual environment called "cf-python-base"
 - Create the first Python program: add.py

### Technical Requirements:
 - Python (version 3.8.7)
 - virtualenvwrapper-win (on Windows)

## Exercise 2:

### Main Goals:
 - Understand variables, data types, and the use of objects in Python
 - Create a data structure for a Recipe app

### Technical Requirements:
 - IPython

### Data Type Justifications:
 - Step 1: I chose to use the dictionary data structure for creating recipe_1 because the dictionary structure can hold strings, integers, and lists. This, in addition to, dictionary structures being mutable allows me to add the name, cooking time, and ingredients of the recipe per the task requirements and edit the recipes as needed.
 - Step 3: I chose to use the list data structure for creating all_recipes because lists are mutable and simpler to read.
